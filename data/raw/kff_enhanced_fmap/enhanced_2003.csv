"Notes"
"Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAPs) are used in determining the amount of Federal payments to a State for medical services. For state-by-state FMAP data please see: [Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for Medicaid and Multiplier](http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/federal-matching-rate-and-multiplier/)."
""
"Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (eFMAPs) are for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) under Title XXI of the Social Security Act. Section 2105(b) of the Act specifies the formula for calculating Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages. "
""
"Section 2101(a) of the Affordable Care Act amended Section 2105(b) of the Social Security Act to increase the enhanced FMAP for states by 23 percentage points, but not to exceed 100 percent, for the period that begins on October 1, 2015 and ends on September 30, 2019 (fiscal years 2016 through 2019). Data for FY 2016, FY 2017, FY 2018, and FY 2019 in this table reflect this modified enhanced FMAP."
""
"Section 3005 of the HEALTHY KIDS Act amended Section 2105(b) of the Social Security Act specifying that the enhanced FMAP for states will be calculated by adding 11.5 percentage points to the state’s enhanced FMAP as provided under section 1905(b) of the Social Security Act, with the sum not to exceed 100 percent, for the period that begins on October 1, 2019 and ends on September 30, 2020 (FY 2020)."
""
"FY 2020, FY 2021, FY 2022, and FY 2023 eFMAPs reflect higher federal matching funding made available through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act). The additional funds are available to states from January 1, 2020 until the end of the public health emergency period for the COVID-19 pandemic. State eFMAPs are capped at 100% for FY 2020 and 85% for FY 2021 and FY 2022.
