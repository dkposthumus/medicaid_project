"Notes"
"The amount of Federal payments to a State for medical services depends on two factors. The first is the actual amount spent that qualifies as matchable under Medicaid and the FMAP. The *Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)* is computed from a formula that takes into account the average per capita income for each State relative to the national average. By law, the FMAP cannot be less than 50%. For more information, please see the KFF policy brief [Medicaid Financing: The Basics](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/)."
""
"The *multiplier* is based on the FMAP. For every dollar the state spends on Medicaid, the federal government matches at a rate that varies year to year. For FY 2004, the rate for Alabama was 1:2.80 (73.70%). For information about the multiplier effect of Medicaid spending, see The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid's policy brief released in December 2008, [Role of Medicaid in State Economies: A Look at the Research](http://www.kff.org/medicaid/7075a.cfm)."

"*Federal Fiscal Year*: FMAPs displayed here apply to the federal fiscal year indicated unless otherwise noted, which runs from October 1 through September 30. For example, FY 2022 refers to the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022."


Footnotes
"1. US federal minimum FMAP is 50%."
"2. The values for the District of Columbia in the table were set for the state plan under titles XIX and XXI and for capitation payments and DSH allotments under those titles. For other purposes, including programs remaining in Title IV of the Act, the percentage for D.C. is 50%, unless otherwise specified by law."
"3. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 set the FMAP for American Samoa, Guam, Northern Marianas, and Virgin Islands permanently at 83% and set the FMAP for Puerto Rico at 76% through FY 2027. For purposes of Section 1118 of the Social Security Act, the percentage used under Titles I, X, XIV, and XVI and Part A of Title IV will be 75%."
