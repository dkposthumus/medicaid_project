"Notes"
"The amount of Federal payments to a State for medical services depends on two factors. The first is the actual amount spent that qualifies as matchable under Medicaid and the FMAP. The *Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)* is computed from a formula that takes into account the average per capita income for each State relative to the national average. By law, the FMAP cannot be less than 50%. For more information, please see the KFF policy brief [Medicaid Financing: An Overview of the Federal Medicaid Matching Rate (FMAP)](http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8352.pdf), September 2012."
""
"The *multiplier* is based on the FMAP. For every dollar the state spends on Medicaid, the federal government matches at a rate that varies year to year. For FY2004, the rate for Alabama was 1:2.80 (73.70%). For information about the multiplier effect of Medicaid spending, see The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid's policy brief released in December 2008, [Role of Medicaid in State Economies: A Look at the Research](http://www.kff.org/medicaid/7075a.cfm)."
""
"FY 2010 FMAPs reflect enhanced federal Medicaid funding available for the fourth quarter of FY 2010 (July 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010) under the under Section 5001 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). There is no quarterly unemployment adjustment for Territories under ARRA."
""
"ARRA holds harmless all states from any declines in their FMAP that would have otherwise occurred based on changes in their per capita income relative to the national average; increases the federal share every state receives by 6.2 percentage points; and further reduces the state share in most states by 5.5%, 8.5%, or 11.5% depending on changes in each state's unemployment rate."
