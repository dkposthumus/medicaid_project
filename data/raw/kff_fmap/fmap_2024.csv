"Notes"
"The amount of Federal payments to a State for medical services depends on two factors. The first is the actual amount spent that qualifies as matchable under Medicaid and the FMAP. The *Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)* is computed from a formula that takes into account the average per capita income for each State relative to the national average. By law, the FMAP cannot be less than 50%. For more information, please see the KFF policy brief [Medicaid Financing: An Overview of the Federal Medicaid Matching Rate (FMAP)](https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8352.pdf), September 2012."
""
"The *multiplier* is based on the FMAP. For every dollar the state spends on Medicaid, the federal government matches at a rate that varies year to year. For FY2004, the rate for Alabama was 1:2.80 (73.70%). For information about the multiplier effect of Medicaid spending, see The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid's policy brief released in December 2008, [Role of Medicaid in State Economies: A Look at the Research](http://www.kff.org/medicaid/7075a.cfm)."
""
"The Families First Coronavirus Response Act authorized a temporary increase of 6.2 percentage points to states' FMAP in excahange for meeting specific Medicaid program requirements. This FMAP increase became available January 1, 2020, the first day of the calendar year quarter in which the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a COVID-19 public health emergency. As provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the increased support will phase down starting on April 1, 2023. The percentage point increase will then be reduced to 5.0 as of April 1, 2023; 2.5 as of July 1, 2023; and 1.5 as of October 1, 2023. It will end entirely as of January 1, 2024."
