"Notes"
"The amount of Federal payments to a State for medical services depends on two factors. The first is the actual amount spent that qualifies as matchable under Medicaid and the FMAP. The *Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)* is computed from a formula that takes into account the average per capita income for each State relative to the national average. By law, the FMAP cannot be less than 50%. For more information, please see the KFF policy brief [Medicaid Financing: An Overview of the Federal Medicaid Matching Rate (FMAP)](https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/8352.pdf), September 2012."
""
"The *multiplier* is based on the FMAP. For every dollar the state spends on Medicaid, the federal government matches at a rate that varies year to year. For FY2004, the rate for Alabama was 1:2.80 (73.70%). For information about the multiplier effect of Medicaid spending, see The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid's policy brief released in December 2008, [Role of Medicaid in State Economies: A Look at the Research](http://www.kff.org/medicaid/7075a.cfm)."
""
"FY 2020, FY 2021, FY 2022, and FY 2023 FMAPs reflect higher federal matching funding made available through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act). The additional funds are available to states from January 1, 2020 until the end of the public health emergency period for the COVID-19 pandemic. This act provided a 6.2 percentage-point increase to all FMAP rates for all states (including DC). For more information on the FMAP increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, see [Key Questions About the New Increase in Federal Medicaid Matching Funds for COVID-19](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/key-questions-about-the-new-increase-in-federal-medicaid-matching-funds-for-covid-19/)"
