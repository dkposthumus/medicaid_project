"Notes"
"The amount of Federal payments to a State for medical services depends on two factors. The first is the actual amount spent that qualifies as matchable under Medicaid and the FMAP. The *Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)* is computed from a formula that takes into account the average per capita income for each State relative to the national average. By law, the FMAP cannot be less than 50%. For more information, please see the KFF policy brief [Medicaid Financing: An Overview of the Federal Medicaid Matching Rate (FMAP)](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-an-overview-of-the-federal/), September 2012."
""
"The *multiplier* is based on the FMAP. For every dollar the state spends on Medicaid, the federal government matches at a rate that varies year to year. For FY2004, the rate for Alabama was 1:2.80 (73.70%). For information about the multiplier effect of Medicaid spending, see The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid's policy brief released in December 2008, [Role of Medicaid in State Economies: A Look at the Research](http://www.kff.org/medicaid/7075a.cfm)."
